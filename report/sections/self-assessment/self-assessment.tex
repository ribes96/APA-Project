% (a) A self-assessment of successes, failures and doubts (I suggest this to be a list
% of one-line items)

\section{Self-assessment of successes, failures and doubts}
\subsection{Successes}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Learn how to train and evaluate different models in a context}
\item{Implementation of F2 score}
\item{Improvement of R programming skills}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Failures}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Found no model that predicts better than the "always false model" (evaluated with F2 score)}
\item{Even though the scores of the models are not that bad, the confusions matrices show that in total many instances are not predicted correctly}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Doubts}
\begin{itemize}
\item{It seems that for KNN the Euclidean metric works better than the Manhattan metric (evaluated with F2 score)}
\end{itemize}
