\section{Possible extensions and known limitations}\label{sec-ext}
Regarding the results of our chosen model we can see that even this model's rate of correct predictions is not very high. As we have only tried to predict with five different models, it is possible that a model we did not try to use would give better predictions for the given dataset. As the related paper suggests to use Support Vector Machines it might well be that such a model gives better predictions. Furthermore we have just begun learning how to use method of Machine Learning and therefore have few experience, so we even might not have found the best parameters to use on the models we chose.

Also we do not have much medical knowledge of the data we have been working with, so we could neither put more emphasis on possibly more significant variables nor declare variables or values as not significant. The modifications we made to the dataset were only based on removing obviously underrepresented or unrealistic data. In cooperation with someone who has medical knowledge of the dataset's variables maybe the process of training could be improved.

As a last limitation the dataset only contains few instances to work with, which are even fewer after the elimination of some instances that we defined as outliers. As the dataset was published in 2013 by now there could be more data available to train on, which we assume would also lead to better results.
