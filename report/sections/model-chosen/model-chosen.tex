\section{Desciption and justification of the final model chosen and estimation of the generalization error}
As we used the F2 score to evaluate the different models, it would be appropriate also to use it to choose the best model amongst them. The model with the highest F2 score is Naive Bayes, but only for one dataset while it at the same time has the lowest F2 score for the other dataset. The chosen model with the highest average F2 score ist the GLM which reaches a mean of 0.69. \\
The GLM also has an average prediction rate of 62\%, calculated with the testing dataset, and therefore a generalization error of 38\%. This is no really a desirable testing error rate, and even more so as the GLM predicts many false negatives which we tried to avoid. These results may be explained by different aspects which are explained in section \ref{sec-ext}.
